# Welcome to Alpha Garden! 🌱

## Alpha Garden Development (agDev) 🚀

Alpha Garden Development (agDev) is the in-progress foundational project at Electric Gardens. This is the primary collaborative space for our Project Development.

###🏗️ What's Growing in the Alpha Garden?

Alpha Garden is where we plant our ideas, create, grow, and nurture the framework of the first of many collective gardens. Together, we're innovating and creating solutions for today and the future. Electric Gardens is a space to have fun, learn, and build in the way that works best for you, in collaboration with others who share your vision.

# TL;DR

We're building a new kind of space where fun and creativity come together, tailored to your needs. After all, it's your space and your idea!
